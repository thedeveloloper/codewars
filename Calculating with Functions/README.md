# Calculating with Functions

- This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some.
- There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
- There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy
- Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
- The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
- Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:

## Examples:

```
seven(times(five())); // must return 35
four(plus(nine())); // must return 13
eight(minus(three())); // must return 5
six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3

```

## Sample Tests

```
describe("Tests", () => {
  it("test", () => {
Test.assertEquals(seven(times(five())), 35);
Test.assertEquals(four(plus(nine())), 13);
Test.assertEquals(eight(minus(three())), 5);
Test.assertEquals(six(dividedBy(two())), 3);
  });
});

```
