# Strip Comments

- whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

## Example:

Given an input string of:

```
apples, pears # and bananas
grapes
bananas !apples
```

The output expected would be:

```
apples, pears
grapes
bananas
```

The code would be called like so:

```
var result = solution("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", ["#", "!"])
// result should == "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas"
```

## Sample Tests

```describe("Tests", () => {
  it("test", () => {
function checkComments(input, markers, expected) {
  var actual;
  actual = solution(input, markers);
  return Test.expect(actual === expected, "Returned '" + actual + "' but expected '" + expected + "'");
};

checkComments("apples, plums % and bananas\npears\noranges !applesauce", ["%", "!"], "apples, plums\npears\noranges")
checkComments("Q @b\nu\ne -e f g", ["@", "-"], "Q\nu\ne")
});
});
```
